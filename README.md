This is my personal website in php. Based on Bootstrap for the design.

If you want to use it for your own, it's totally fine.
It contains 5 sections: #home - #about - #skills - #contact - #blog. The subdomain lab is working but not finished yet. It'll be used to show my experiments, whatever they are. 


You can find the online version of it at http://nicolasbrugneaux.me
